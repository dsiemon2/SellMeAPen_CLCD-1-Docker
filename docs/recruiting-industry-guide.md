## Industry Overview

### The Recruiting Sales Challenge

Recruiting is a **two-sided sales profession**:
1. **Client-side (Business Development)**: Selling your services to hiring companies
2. **Candidate-side (Candidate Marketing)**: Selling opportunities to passive candidates

Most recruiters struggle because they're trained on process, not persuasion. They know how to source candidates and post jobs, but not how to:
- Win new client accounts against competitors
- Convince passive candidates to consider a move
- Negotiate fees without caving
- Handle objections from skeptical HR directors
- Close exclusive agreements instead of contingent

### Market Opportunity

| Segment | Size | Training Need |
|---------|------|---------------|
| Staffing agencies | 20,000+ firms in US | BD skills, candidate persuasion |
| Corporate recruiters | 200,000+ professionals | Candidate selling, hiring manager influence |
| Executive search | 5,000+ boutique firms | C-level conversations, fee negotiation |
| RPO providers | Growing rapidly | Scalable training for large teams |

### Pain Points We Solve

| Pain Point | Current Solution | AI Training Solution |
|------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| New recruiters can't close | Shadow senior recruiters for months | Practice 50+ scenarios in weeks |
| BD calls are awkward | Role-play with managers (inconsistent) | Unlimited realistic practice |
| Fee negotiation weakness | Learn by losing deals | Safe environment to build confidence |
| Candidate objection handling | Trial and error | Master common objections systematically |
| Scaling training | One-on-one coaching (expensive) | AI scales infinitely |

---

## Why Recruiting Needs Sales Training

### The Revenue Impact

```
Average recruiter metrics:
- 50 BD calls/week → 5 meetings → 1 new client/month
- Average placement fee: $25,000
- Recruiter who improves close rate by 20% = +$60k/year revenue

Training ROI calculation:
- AI training cost: ~$100/month per recruiter
- If training improves close rate by just 10%
- ROI: 25x+ on training investment
```

### Skills Gap Analysis

| Skill | % of Recruiters Proficient | Business Impact |
|-------|---------------------------|-----------------|
| Cold calling / BD | 25% | Limits new client acquisition |
| Fee negotiation | 30% | Leaves money on table |
| Candidate persuasion | 40% | Loses top candidates to competitors |
| Objection handling | 35% | Deals stall or die |
| Closing | 30% | Pipeline doesn't convert |

### Why Traditional Training Fails

1. **Role-play is awkward**: Practicing with colleagues feels fake
2. **Managers are busy**: Can't dedicate hours to each new hire
3. **Inconsistent feedback**: Different managers teach different things
4. **No safe space to fail**: Real calls have real consequences
5. **Can't practice at scale**: Limited by human availability

### Why AI Training Works for Recruiting

1. **Unlimited practice**: Reps can run 10 scenarios a day
2. **Consistent personas**: Same objections, fair difficulty every time
3. **Safe to fail**: No lost deals, no embarrassment
4. **Immediate feedback**: Know what to improve after each call
5. **Scales with team**: Train 5 or 500 recruiters the same way
6. **Available 24/7**: Practice before a big call, on weekends, anytime

## Detailed Scenario Configurations

### Scenario 1: New Client Acquisition Call

**The Most Important BD Skill**

```
SCENARIO: Cold Call to HR Director
DIFFICULTY: Medium
GOAL: Book a 30-minute discovery meeting

SITUATION:
You're calling Maria Santos, HR Director at FinanceFlow, a fintech
startup with 150 employees. They have a VP of Engineering role open
(you found it on LinkedIn). You want to introduce your firm and book
a meeting to discuss their hiring needs.

Maria is skeptical of recruiters. She's had mixed experiences. She's
busy and gets 5+ recruiter calls per week. She's considering posting
on LinkedIn herself.
```

**AI Persona Configuration:**

```
You are Maria Santos, HR Director at FinanceFlow.

CONTEXT:
- Fintech startup, 150 employees, Series B
- You have 3 open roles: VP Engineering (critical), 2 senior devs
- Your ATS is full of applications but quality is low
- You've used recruiters before - some great, some terrible
- You're skeptical of cold calls from recruiters
- You get 5+ recruiter calls per week

YOUR DEFAULT RESPONSE:
- Polite but guarded
- "We're not working with new agencies right now"
- "Send me an email and I'll review it"
- "We have preferred vendors we work with"

WHAT GETS YOUR ATTENTION:
- Specific knowledge about fintech engineering talent
- Reference to a company similar to yours
- Understanding of your specific challenges
- Not sounding like every other recruiter call

OBJECTIONS TO USE:
- "We're working with our preferred agencies already"
- "I don't have time for another recruiter meeting"
- "Just send me your information by email"
- "We've had bad experiences with recruiters"
- "How is your firm different from the others?"
- "We're trying to keep fees down - are you competitive?"

YOU'LL BOOK A MEETING IF:
- The recruiter asks intelligent questions
- They demonstrate fintech expertise
- They reference relevant placements
- They don't sound scripted
- They respect your time (keep it brief)
- They offer something valuable (market insights, etc.)

YOU'LL END THE CALL IF:
- They launch into a pitch without asking about your needs
- They're pushy or won't take a soft no
- They can't answer basic questions about their experience
- They sound like every other recruiter
```

**Scorecard:**

| Category | Weight | Criteria |
|----------|--------|----------|
| Opening | 20% | Clear intro, permission to continue, hook |
| Discovery | 30% | Asked about current situation, challenges, timeline |
| Value Prop | 25% | Differentiated pitch, relevant experience mentioned |
| Closing | 25% | Asked for meeting, handled objection, secured next step |

**Training Tips for Recruiters:**

1. **Research before calling**: Know their open roles, company stage, recent news
2. **Lead with insight, not pitch**: "I noticed you've had that VP role open for 6 weeks..."
3. **Ask permission**: "Do you have 2 minutes or did I catch you at a bad time?"
4. **Acknowledge their skepticism**: "I know you probably get a lot of these calls..."
5. **Offer value first**: "Even if we don't work together, I can share what we're seeing in fintech hiring"
6. **Keep it short**: Goal is the meeting, not the sale

---

### Scenario 2: Fee Negotiation

**Where Recruiters Leave Money on the Table**

```
SCENARIO: Fee Negotiation with New Client
DIFFICULTY: Hard
GOAL: Maintain your fee structure (25% retained or 20% contingent)

SITUATION:
You've had a great discovery meeting with David Chen, VP of Talent
at GrowthCo (500-person SaaS company). They want to hire a VP of
Sales. You've presented your retained search proposal at 25% of
first-year comp (~$75k fee). David is pushing back on price.
```

**AI Persona Configuration:**

```
You are David Chen, VP of Talent at GrowthCo.

CONTEXT:
- 500-person SaaS company, growing fast
- Need to hire VP of Sales ($280-320k base + bonus)
- You like this recruiter and their approach
- But you have budget pressure from your CFO
- You've worked with cheaper firms before (20%)
- You have 3 other search firms to consider

YOUR NEGOTIATION APPROACH:
- You're not trying to be difficult
- But you have real budget constraints
- You want the best deal possible
- You'll pay more for clear value

YOUR OPENING POSITION:
- "25% is higher than what we typically pay"
- "Our standard is 20% contingent"
- "Can you match what other firms have quoted?"

OBJECTIONS TO USE:
- "We've never paid more than 20% for a search"
- "Another firm quoted us 18% for this search"
- "Can you do 22% as a compromise?"
- "If this works out, we have 5 more searches this year"
- "We can't do retained - only pay on results"
- "Can you guarantee placement in 60 days?"

YOUR REAL BOTTOM LINE:
- You can pay 23-25% if they justify it
- You prefer retained if they have a track record
- You'll go contingent at 20% with the right firm
- You won't go below 18% (signals low quality)

YOU'LL AGREE TO 25% RETAINED IF:
- They hold firm but explain their value
- They show relevant VP Sales placements
- They offer meaningful guarantees
- They demonstrate confidence in their process
- They don't cave immediately (signals weakness)

YOU'LL PUSH FOR CONTINGENT IF:
- They can't differentiate from cheaper options
- They immediately start discounting
- They seem desperate for the business
- They can't show relevant experience

RED FLAGS THAT MAKE YOU WALK:
- They agree to everything you ask (too eager)
- They badmouth competitors
- They can't explain why they're worth more
- They're inflexible on everything (not a partner)
```

**Common Mistakes Recruiters Make:**

| Mistake | Impact | Better Approach |
|---------|--------|-----------------|
| Immediately discounting | Signals desperation | "Let me explain our value first" |
| Apologizing for fee | Undermines confidence | "Our fee reflects our results" |
| Badmouthing cheaper competitors | Looks unprofessional | Focus on your value, not their weakness |
| No counter-offer | Leaves money on table | "I can do 23% with these terms..." |
| Caving without getting something | One-sided negotiation | "If I reduce to 22%, I need exclusivity" |

**Negotiation Scripts to Practice:**

```
CLIENT: "25% is too high. Our standard is 20%."

WEAK RESPONSE: "Okay, we can do 20% to win your business."

STRONG RESPONSE: "I understand budget is a factor. Let me share
why clients choose to work with us at our standard rate, and then
if you still want to discuss terms, I'm open to finding a structure
that works for both of us."

---

CLIENT: "Another firm quoted 18%."

WEAK RESPONSE: "We can match that."

STRONG RESPONSE: "I'm not surprised - there's a wide range of firms
in the market. The question is what you're getting for that fee.
When we place a VP of Sales, our candidates stay an average of 4.2
years. What's turnover cost you on a bad hire at this level?"

---

CLIENT: "We only do contingent."

WEAK RESPONSE: "Okay, we'll work contingent."

STRONG RESPONSE: "I can work contingent in some situations. For a
VP of Sales role, my concern is that contingent creates pressure
to move fast rather than find the right person. What's more
important to you - speed or getting this hire right?"
```

---

### Scenario 3: Passive Candidate Outreach

**Converting Happy Employees into Candidates**

```
SCENARIO: Cold Outreach to Passive Candidate
DIFFICULTY: Medium
GOAL: Get candidate interested enough to have a conversation

SITUATION:
You're reaching out to Jennifer Park, a Senior Director of
Engineering at a successful startup. She's been there 4 years,
recently promoted, and isn't actively looking. You have a VP of
Engineering role at a larger company that would be a big step up.
```

**AI Persona Configuration:**

```
You are Jennifer Park, Senior Director of Engineering.

CONTEXT:
- You've been at your current company 4 years
- Promoted to Senior Director 8 months ago
- You like your job, your team, your company
- But you've been wondering "what's next?"
- Your company is great but maybe you've learned what you can
- You're not on job boards, not actively looking
- But you're open to hearing about the right opportunity

YOUR DEFAULT RESPONSE:
- "I'm not really looking right now"
- "I'm pretty happy where I am"
- "Send me the job description and I'll take a look"
- "I don't have time for interviews right now"

WHAT ACTUALLY INTERESTS YOU (don't reveal easily):
- VP title (step up from Director)
- Larger engineering organization to lead
- Equity in a company with real upside
- Interesting technical challenges
- Working for a CEO with a strong reputation

OBJECTIONS TO USE:
- "I just got promoted, it would look bad to leave"
- "I'm not looking to make a move right now"
- "What's the company? I need to know before talking"
- "I'm pretty happy with my compensation"
- "I don't have time for a long interview process"
- "I get a lot of these messages, what makes this different?"

YOU'LL AGREE TO A CALL IF:
- The opportunity sounds like a clear step up
- The recruiter is respectful and not pushy
- They understand your situation (not just selling)
- The company sounds interesting
- The recruiter can articulate why this fits your career
- They don't pressure you to decide immediately

YOU'LL DECLINE IF:
- It sounds like a lateral move
- The recruiter is pushy or salesy
- They can't answer basic questions
- They're evasive about the company
- They're clearly just filling a req, not matching fit
```

**Outreach Frameworks to Practice:**

**The "Career Insight" Approach:**
```
"Jennifer, I came across your profile and was impressed by how you've
scaled the engineering team at [Company]. I'm working with a company
where the CEO specifically mentioned wanting a leader who's done
exactly that. It's a VP role leading a 60-person team.

I know you're probably not actively looking, but this seemed too
aligned to not mention. Would you be open to a quick call to see
if it's worth exploring? Even if it's not the right time, I'd enjoy
connecting."
```

**The "Challenge the Status Quo" Approach:**
```
"Jennifer, random question - if someone offered you the chance to
lead a 60-person engineering org with a VP title and meaningful
equity, would that be interesting enough to have a conversation?

No pressure either way, but I'm working on a search that made me
think of your background."
```

**The "Insight-First" Approach:**
```
"Jennifer, I've been mapping the fintech engineering leadership
market for a search I'm running. Your trajectory from IC to Director
in 4 years at [Company] stood out.

Quick question - is leading a larger organization something that's
on your radar, or are you in a building phase where you are?"
```

---

### Scenario 4: Counter-Offer Defense

**The Most Lost Candidates**

```
SCENARIO: Candidate Gets Counter-Offer
DIFFICULTY: Hard
GOAL: Keep candidate committed to accepting your client's offer

SITUATION:
Michael Torres accepted your client's offer yesterday. He gave notice
this morning. Now he's calling you because his current employer
made an aggressive counter-offer - $20k more plus a promotion
to Director. He's wavering.
```

**AI Persona Configuration:**

```
You are Michael Torres, a candidate who just got a counter-offer.

SITUATION:
- You accepted an offer for VP of Product at a new company
- Compensation: $260k base, 20% bonus, equity
- You gave notice this morning
- Your current employer countered: $280k + promotion to Director

YOUR EMOTIONAL STATE:
- Conflicted and anxious
- Flattered by the counter-offer
- Feeling guilty about leaving
- Worried about making the wrong choice
- Your spouse is asking "why leave if they'll pay more to stay?"

WHAT YOU'RE THINKING:
- "They're finally recognizing my value"
- "The new job is risky - I know this company"
- "Maybe I was just using the offer as leverage"
- "What if the new company doesn't work out?"
- "But... why did it take me quitting to get this?"

OBJECTIONS YOU'LL RAISE:
- "They offered me $20k more to stay"
- "They're promoting me to Director"
- "I know everyone here, new job is a risk"
- "My wife thinks I should take the counter"
- "Maybe I wasn't being paid fairly, and now I am"
- "What if the new job doesn't work out?"

WHAT KEEPS YOU ON TRACK:
- Reminder of why you started looking
- Reality check on counter-offer statistics
- Focus on career growth, not just money
- Emotional anchoring to the new opportunity
- Respect for your decision-making process

WHAT MAKES YOU TAKE THE COUNTER:
- Recruiter dismisses your concerns
- Recruiter pressures you
- Recruiter gets angry
- No compelling reason to stay committed
- Feeling like a transaction, not a person
```

**Counter-Offer Defense Scripts:**

**Script 1: The Reality Check**
```
"Michael, I hear you - that's a meaningful offer from your current
company. Can I ask you a few questions before you decide?

When you came to me 6 weeks ago, what made you start looking?
[Let them answer]

Has any of that changed because of this counter-offer?
[Usually the answer is no]

Here's what I've seen in 10 years of recruiting: the reasons
people start looking rarely go away because of money. The stats
show that 70-80% of people who accept counter-offers leave within
18 months anyway.

I'm not going to pressure you. But I want to make sure you're
making this decision based on what's right for your career, not
just what feels safe in this moment."
```

**Script 2: The Future Focus**
```
"Let me ask you this: Six months from now, in which scenario
are you more likely to be happy?

Scenario A: You stayed, you have more money, but the reasons
you were frustrated are still there, and now your employer
knows you were looking to leave.

Scenario B: You took the risk, you're in a new environment,
you're challenged, and you're growing into a VP role.

Which one excites you more?"
```

**Script 3: The Emotional Anchor**
```
"Remember our first call when you told me about [specific
frustration they mentioned]? You said you couldn't see yourself
there in 2 years.

Nothing about that has changed. What's changed is they finally
realized what you're worth - after you were ready to leave.

What does that tell you about how they'll treat you going forward?"
```

---

### Scenario 5: Exclusive Agreement Negotiation

**Moving from Contingent to Retained/Exclusive**

```
SCENARIO: Pitching Exclusive/Retained Search
DIFFICULTY: Hard
GOAL: Win retained or exclusive agreement instead of contingent

SITUATION:
After a successful discovery meeting, the client wants to work
with you on a VP of Marketing search. They're defaulting to
contingent. You want retained or at minimum exclusive contingent.
```

**AI Persona Configuration:**

```
You are Lisa Chang, Chief People Officer at ScaleUp Inc.

CONTEXT:
- 300-person B2B SaaS company
- Need VP of Marketing (critical hire)
- Previous VP left 2 months ago
- You typically work contingent with 2-3 agencies
- You've never done a retained search
- Budget-conscious but need this hire fast

YOUR POSITION:
- "We always work contingent"
- "Why would I pay upfront for something not guaranteed?"
- "More agencies means more candidates, right?"
- "Retained is for C-suite, not VP level"

WHAT WOULD CHANGE YOUR MIND:
- Clear explanation of why retained works better
- Risk mitigation (guarantee, milestone payments)
- Exclusive access to better candidates
- Evidence that contingent approach isn't working
- Understanding the true cost of a bad/slow hire

NEGOTIATION POINTS:
- "Can we do contingent to start and see how it goes?"
- "What if I give you exclusive for 30 days?"
- "I'll consider retained if you guarantee placement"
- "What are your milestone payments?"
- "We need this filled in 60 days - can you commit?"
```

**Retained Search Pitch Framework:**

```
1. ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR POSITION
"I understand you typically work contingent. Most companies do.
Can I share why that approach might not serve you well for this
particular search, and then you can decide?"

2. EXPLAIN THE PROBLEM WITH CONTINGENT
"When you give this search to 3 agencies on contingent, here's
what happens:
- Each agency has 33% chance of getting paid
- So they spend 33% of their effort
- They send candidates from their database
- They don't do deep market research
- It becomes a resume race, not a quality search"

3. CONTRAST WITH RETAINED
"With a retained search:
- I'm 100% committed because you're 100% committed
- I do original research - mapping the entire market
- I recruit passive candidates who aren't on job boards
- I'm your partner, not competing with other agencies
- I present 3-5 exceptional candidates, not 15 marginal ones"

4. MITIGATE RISK
"I know you're concerned about paying upfront. Here's how we
structure it:
- Three payments: 1/3 at start, 1/3 at slate, 1/3 at hire
- 90-day guarantee - if they leave, we replace free
- Weekly updates so you always know status
- If I don't perform, you stop payment"

5. QUANTIFY THE COST OF STATUS QUO
"Your VP of Marketing role has been open 2 months. What's that
costing you in:
- Pipeline not being built?
- Team without leadership?
- Competitors moving faster?

A 60-day retained search will cost you $X. How does that compare
to another 2-3 months without a leader?"

6. OFFER AN ALTERNATIVE
"If retained isn't possible, here's what I'd propose: Exclusive
contingent for 45 days. You work with only me, I give you my full
commitment, and you only pay on success. If I don't produce in 45
days, you can open it up. Fair?"
```

## AI Cheating Detection for Technical Assessments

### The Problem: Candidates Using AI to Cheat

With the rise of ChatGPT, Claude, and other AI tools, recruiters face a new challenge: **candidates using AI to answer technical questions during interviews and assessments.**

Signs of AI-assisted cheating:
- Unnaturally perfect, textbook answers
- Responses that sound "written" rather than spoken
- Pauses followed by suddenly fluent, structured answers
- Inability to go deeper when probed
- Answers that don't match the candidate's apparent experience level

### AI Detection System Overview

Our platform can analyze candidate responses in real-time to detect potential AI assistance:

### Detection Method 1: Linguistic Analysis

AI-generated responses have telltale patterns:

| AI Pattern | Human Pattern | Detection |
|------------|---------------|-----------|
| Perfect structure (intro, body, conclusion) | Organic, sometimes rambling | Structure scoring |
| Hedging language ("It's worth noting...") | Direct statements | Phrase detection |
| Comprehensive coverage of all aspects | Focus on what they know | Completeness analysis |
| Consistent tone throughout | Natural variation | Tone consistency |
| Technical jargon used perfectly | Occasional misuse or simplification | Jargon pattern matching |
| No filler words (um, like, you know) | Natural filler words | Speech pattern analysis |

**Implementation:**

```typescript
interface LinguisticAnalysis {
  structureScore: number;      // How "perfectly structured" (high = suspicious)
  hedgingPhrases: string[];    // AI-typical phrases detected
  completenessScore: number;   // Suspiciously comprehensive?
  fillerWordRatio: number;     // Low ratio in voice = suspicious
  jargonAccuracy: number;      // Too perfect = suspicious
  overallSuspicionScore: number;
}

const AI_INDICATOR_PHRASES = [
  "It's worth noting that",
  "There are several key considerations",
  "Let me break this down",
  "From a technical standpoint",
  "In terms of",
  "It's important to understand that",
  "Generally speaking",
  "That being said",
  "To summarize",
  "The main takeaway is"
];

function analyzeResponse(response: string): LinguisticAnalysis {
  // Count AI indicator phrases
  const hedgingPhrases = AI_INDICATOR_PHRASES.filter(
    phrase => response.toLowerCase().includes(phrase.toLowerCase())
  );

  // Check for perfect structure
  const hasIntro = /^(So,|Well,|Great question|To answer|Let me)/i.test(response);
  const hasConclusion = /(In summary|To conclude|Overall|The key point)/i.test(response);
  const structureScore = (hasIntro ? 30 : 0) + (hasConclusion ? 30 : 0) +
    (hedgingPhrases.length * 10);

  // More analysis...
  return {
    structureScore,
    hedgingPhrases,
    completenessScore: calculateCompleteness(response),
    fillerWordRatio: countFillerWords(response) / wordCount(response),
    jargonAccuracy: analyzeJargonUsage(response),
    overallSuspicionScore: calculateOverallScore(...)
  };
}
```

### Detection Method 2: Timing Anomaly Detection

AI users have distinctive timing patterns:

```
NORMAL CANDIDATE TIMING:
Question asked → 2-5 sec thinking → Start talking → Natural flow with pauses

AI-ASSISTED TIMING:
Question asked → 8-15 sec delay (typing/reading) → Sudden fluent response

COPY-PASTE TIMING:
Question asked → 10-20 sec delay → Perfect answer with no corrections
```

**Implementation:**

```typescript
interface TimingAnalysis {
  responseDelay: number;        // Seconds before first word
  pausePattern: number[];       // Pauses during response
  fluencyAfterDelay: number;    // How fluent after long pause (suspicious)
  typingPatternDetected: boolean; // Keyboard sounds in audio
  readingPatternDetected: boolean; // Eye movement if video
}

function analyzeTimingPatterns(
  questionTimestamp: number,
  responseStart: number,
  responsePauses: number[],
  responseQuality: number
): TimingAnalysis {

  const delay = responseStart - questionTimestamp;

  // Suspicious: Long delay followed by very fluent, high-quality response
  const suspiciousPattern =
    delay > 10 && // Long delay
    responsePauses.length < 3 && // Few pauses
    responseQuality > 85; // Very polished answer

  return {
    responseDelay: delay,
    pausePattern: responsePauses,
    fluencyAfterDelay: suspiciousPattern ? 0.9 : 0.3,
    typingPatternDetected: detectTypingSounds(audioBuffer),
    readingPatternDetected: detectReadingEyeMovement(videoBuffer)
  };
}
```

**Timing Red Flags:**

| Delay | Response Quality | Suspicion Level |
|-------|-----------------|-----------------|
| 2-5 sec | Any | Normal |
| 5-10 sec | Average | Normal (thinking) |
| 5-10 sec | Excellent | Slightly suspicious |
| 10-20 sec | Average | Normal (complex question) |
| 10-20 sec | Perfect, fluent | HIGH SUSPICION |
| 20+ sec | Perfect | VERY HIGH SUSPICION |

### Detection Method 3: Depth Probing

The most effective detection: **AI users can't go deeper.**

When a candidate gives a suspiciously perfect answer, automatically generate follow-up probes:

```
ORIGINAL QUESTION:
"Explain how you would optimize a slow SQL query."

SUSPICIOUS ANSWER (AI-generated):
"To optimize a slow SQL query, I would first analyze the execution plan
using EXPLAIN. Then I'd look at indexing opportunities, check for N+1
query problems, consider query restructuring, evaluate if caching is
appropriate, and potentially denormalize if read performance is critical.
I'd also review connection pooling and consider read replicas for scale."

DEPTH PROBES (auto-generated):
1. "You mentioned execution plans - walk me through a specific time you
   found something unexpected in an execution plan."

2. "What's the most complex indexing decision you've had to make? What
   were the tradeoffs?"

3. "You mentioned N+1 problems - how do you detect these in a codebase
   you're unfamiliar with?"

4. "Tell me about a time when caching caused more problems than it solved."
```

**AI users will struggle with:**
- Specific personal experiences
- Tradeoff discussions with nuance
- Debugging war stories
- "Tell me about a time when X didn't work"
- Edge cases and exceptions to their stated rules

**Implementation:**

```typescript
interface DepthProbe {
  originalQuestion: string;
  suspiciousAnswer: string;
  probeQuestions: string[];
  probeResponses: ProbeResponse[];
  depthScore: number; // How well they handled probing
}

interface ProbeResponse {
  question: string;
  response: string;
  quality: number;
  specificity: number;  // Did they give a specific example?
  consistency: number;  // Consistent with original answer?
}

async function generateDepthProbes(
  question: string,
  answer: string,
  role: string
): Promise<string[]> {

  const prompt = `
    A candidate for a ${role} position was asked:
    "${question}"

    They gave this answer:
    "${answer}"

    Generate 3 follow-up questions that:
    1. Ask for a specific personal experience related to their answer
    2. Probe a tradeoff or nuance they glossed over
    3. Ask about a time something went wrong related to this topic

    These questions should be easy for someone with real experience but
    difficult for someone who just read a textbook answer or used AI.
  `;

  return await generateProbeQuestions(prompt);
}

function scoreDepthResponses(probes: ProbeResponse[]): number {
  let score = 0;

  for (const probe of probes) {
    // Did they give a specific example?
    if (probe.specificity > 0.7) score += 25;

    // Was the example consistent with their claimed experience?
    if (probe.consistency > 0.8) score += 25;

    // Did they handle the "what went wrong" question?
    const wrWrongProbe = probe.question.includes('wrong') ||
                         probe.question.includes("didn't work");
    if (wrongProbe && probe.quality > 0.6) score += 25;
  }

  return Math.min(score, 100);
}
```

### Detection Method 4: Consistency Checking

Cross-reference answers across multiple questions:

```
QUESTION 1: "What's your experience with React?"
ANSWER 1: "I've worked extensively with React for 5 years, including
Redux, React Query, and Next.js..."

QUESTION 5: "Walk me through how you'd set up state management."
ANSWER 5: [Gives textbook Redux answer but can't explain why they'd
choose Redux over Context or React Query]

INCONSISTENCY DETECTED:
- Claims 5 years experience
- Can't discuss tradeoffs that any experienced React dev would know
```

**Implementation:**

```typescript
interface ConsistencyCheck {
  claimedExperience: Map<string, number>; // Tech -> years claimed
  demonstratedKnowledge: Map<string, number>; // Tech -> actual depth shown
  inconsistencies: Inconsistency[];
}

interface Inconsistency {
  technology: string;
  claimed: string;
  demonstrated: string;
  severity: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
  explanation: string;
}

function checkConsistency(
  allResponses: QuestionResponse[]
): ConsistencyCheck {

  // Extract experience claims
  const claims = extractExperienceClaims(allResponses);

  // Assess demonstrated knowledge
  const demonstrated = assessDemonstratedKnowledge(allResponses);

  // Find mismatches
  const inconsistencies: Inconsistency[] = [];

  for (const [tech, claimedYears] of claims) {
    const demoLevel = demonstrated.get(tech) || 0;

    // 5 years claimed but junior-level answers
    if (claimedYears >= 5 && demoLevel < 3) {
      inconsistencies.push({
        technology: tech,
        claimed: `${claimedYears} years experience`,
        demonstrated: 'Junior-level responses',
        severity: 'high',
        explanation: `Candidate claims ${claimedYears} years with ${tech}
          but couldn't discuss common tradeoffs or provide specific examples`
      });
    }
  }

  return { claimedExperience: claims, demonstratedKnowledge: demonstrated, inconsistencies };
}
```

### Ethical Considerations

**Important Guidelines:**

1. **Never auto-reject** based on AI detection alone
   - False positives happen (nervous candidates, ESL speakers)
   - Use as input, not verdict

2. **Inform candidates** that AI detection is used
   - Transparency builds trust
   - May deter cheating

3. **Focus on depth, not gotchas**
   - Goal is finding qualified candidates
   - Not catching cheaters for sport

4. **Allow for explanation**
   - If flagged, give candidate chance to demonstrate in live setting
   - Some people research before interviews (that's good!)

5. **Calibrate for role**
   - Entry-level: more lenient (they're learning)
   - Senior roles: depth probing is fair game

6. **Continuously improve**
   - AI is getting better
   - Detection must evolve too

### Integration with Recruiting Workflow

```
ASSESSMENT FLOW:

1. CANDIDATE RECEIVES ASSESSMENT
   └── 12 technical questions
   └── Mix of types (standard, experience, traps)
   └── Time-boxed (45-60 minutes)

2. AI DETECTION RUNS IN BACKGROUND
   └── Real-time linguistic analysis
   └── Timing pattern tracking
   └── Response quality scoring

3. INITIAL RESULTS TO RECRUITER
   └── Overall suspicion score
   └── Flagged questions highlighted
   └── Recommended follow-ups

4. RECRUITER REVIEWS
   ├── Low suspicion (< 40%) → Proceed to interview
   ├── Medium suspicion (40-70%) → Live technical screen with probing
   └── High suspicion (> 70%) → Additional verification required

5. LIVE FOLLOW-UP (if needed)
   └── Re-ask flagged questions
   └── Require screen sharing
   └── Live coding exercise
   └── Deep probing on experience claims

6. FINAL DECISION
   └── Combines assessment + detection + live performance
   └── Documented reasoning
```

## Getting Started

### Immediate Actions

1. **Identify top 3 skill gaps** on your team
2. **Select 3-5 pilot users** across experience levels
3. **Deploy core scenarios**: Cold call, Fee negotiation, Passive outreach
4. **Set baseline metrics**: Current close rates, fees, ramp time
5. **Run 30-day pilot** with weekly check-ins
6. **Measure and iterate**

### Success Criteria for Pilot

- [ ] 80%+ of pilot users complete 10+ scenarios
- [ ] Average scores improve by 10% over 30 days
- [ ] Users report increased confidence on real calls
- [ ] At least one "win story" attributed to practice
